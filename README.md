Isla J., JÃ¡come-Flores M, Pareja D., Jordano P. 2022. Drivers of individual-based, antagonistic interaction networks during plant range expansion. 
Journal of Ecology. (VOL; PAGES; DOI)

Range expansion in plant populations can be either limited by e ects of antagonistic interactions
or facilitated by their release. Using innovative, individual-based interaction networks and ERGM
models we document interactions turnover and network reconfigurations along the range shift.
Seven pulp-seed consumer animal species varied significantly in their frequency of interaction
and prevalence. Individual plant traits strongly determined the topology of these networks,
although with di erences between stands. Antagonistic load at the colonization front was
concentrated in a reduced subset of plants, where invertebrate species showed reduced
interaction weights. However, the disproportionately large e ect of avian seed predators
potentially results in large seed losses during range expansion. We found no evidence of a
complete antagonist release of Juniperus phoenicea at the colonization front but resulting in more
heterogeneous interaction strengths among individual plants.
